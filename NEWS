* clm() - complex linear model for complex regression models.
* complex2mat() and complex2vec() functions for switching between complex variables and matrices/vectors.
* mat2complex() and vec2complex() functions to reverse what the previous two do.
* vcov(), confint() and summary() for clm class.
* covar() function to produce covariance matrix from a random complex variable.
* summary.clm() now has an option to produce real-valued parameters via complex=FALSE.
